In this application, the front end allows users to interact with their to-do list via a responsive UI built with React. 
The back end handles data storage and retrieval, ensuring that the to-do items persist across sessions. Together, these components create a functional and practical to-do list application.

Front End (React)
Project Structure:

src/
components/
TodoList.js: Displays the list of to-dos.
TodoItem.js: Represents a single to-do item with options to edit or delete.
TodoForm.js: Form for adding new to-dos.
clientsrcApp.js: Main component that holds state and handles API calls.

State Management:

Use the useState hook to manage the list of to-dos.
Use the useEffect hook to fetch the existing to-dos from the back end when the component mounts.
API Calls:

Use axios or the Fetch API to make HTTP requests to the back end.
Implement functions to handle adding, updating, and deleting to-dos by making POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, respectively.
UI Components:

The TodoForm component includes an input field and a button to submit new to-dos.
The TodoList component maps through the to-do items and renders a TodoItem for each one.
Styling:

Basic CSS styling can be applied to create a user-friendly interface.
Back End (Node.js with Express)
Project Structure:

server.js: Main file to set up the Express server.
routes/
Routes.js(backend): Handles routing for to-do-related API endpoints.
models/
components.js: Mongoose model for to-do items (if using MongoDB).

Implement basic error handling to return appropriate status codes and messages.
